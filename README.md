## Contributing
### Prerequisites

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Remote Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Open in Container

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Open the repository in VSCode
1. A window will pop up in the lower left corner, asking if you want to open the repository in a container. Click "Reopen in Container"
 (**OR** press `F1` and type "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

    > **Note:**
    > Container will be built the first time you open the repository in a container.
    > This may take a few minutes. Subsequent opens will be much faster.

1. Home Assistant is started automatically in the container, you can access it at http://localhost:8123 (don't close the starting terminal since this runs home assistance, instead open a second terminal in parallell)

> **Tip:** Open a terminal in the container and run `container help` to see a list of available container commands.
